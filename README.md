## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.
Requirement analysis is important because it is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that development efforts are focused on solving the right problems, for the right users, in the right way.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement analysis plays a vital role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that the development process is guided by clear, complete, and agreed-upon objectives. Below are three key reasons why this phase is critical in (SDLC):

### 1. Ensures Project Clarity and Alignment

Requirement analysis defines what the software should do, who it's for, and the problems it solves. This clarity helps:

- Developers understand what to build
- Stakeholders align on expectations
- The team stay focused on business goals

### 2. Reduces Costly Errors and Rework

Identifying and resolving issues during the requirement phase is far more cost-effective than fixing them later. Thorough analysis prevents:

- Miscommunication
- Unnecessary features
- Expensive last-minute changes

### 3. Provides a Foundation for Testing and Validation

Requirements serve as the baseline for test planning. They allow the QA team to:

- Verify that features meet expectations
- Ensure no requirement is overlooked
- Build test cases directly linked to user needs
