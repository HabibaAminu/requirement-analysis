## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.
Requirement analysis is important because it is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that development efforts are focused on solving the right problems, for the right users, in the right way.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement analysis plays a vital role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that the development process is guided by clear, complete, and agreed-upon objectives. Below are three key reasons why this phase is critical in (SDLC):

### 1. Ensures Project Clarity and Alignment

Requirement analysis defines what the software should do, who it's for, and the problems it solves. This clarity helps:

- Developers understand what to build
- Stakeholders align on expectations
- The team stay focused on business goals

### 2. Reduces Costly Errors and Rework

Identifying and resolving issues during the requirement phase is far more cost-effective than fixing them later. Thorough analysis prevents:

- Miscommunication
- Unnecessary features
- Expensive last-minute changes

### 3. Provides a Foundation for Testing and Validation

Requirements serve as the baseline for test planning. They allow the QA team to:

- Verify that features meet expectations
- Ensure no requirement is overlooked
- Build test cases directly linked to user needs

#### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis phase includes several important activities that ensure the software being developed meets user and business needs. Below are the five core activities and what each involves:

### 1. Requirement Gathering

- Involves collecting information from stakeholders (clients, users, managers) about their needs and expectations.
- Focuses on identifying high-level business goals and user requirements.
- Common methods: interviews, surveys, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions.

### 2. Requirement Elicitation

- It involves drawing out hidden, implied, or unclear requirements.
- Helps uncover real needs that users may not express directly.
- Techniques include observation, use case development, workshops, and prototyping.

### 3. Requirement Documentation

- Involves organizing the gathered and elicited information into a formal document.
- Ensures that requirements are clearly written, traceable, and understandable to all stakeholders.
- Common artifacts: Software Requirement Specification (SRS), user stories, use case diagrams.

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling

- Focuses on examining and refining the documented requirements for completeness, consistency, and feasibility.
- May include modeling using diagrams (e.g., flowcharts, UML diagrams) to visualize system behavior.
- Helps identify conflicting, duplicate, or vague requirements before development begins.

### 5. Requirement Validation

- Ensures that all requirements are correct, complete, and agreed upon by all stakeholders.
- Confirms that documented requirements truly reflect user needs.
- Techniques include reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and formal approval processes.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements

These are the core features and actions the booking system must support.

- User registration and login
- Service search and filtering
- Create/view/cancel bookings
- Admin: manage availability
- Auto email confirmations
- Booking history/reporting

### Non-Functional Requirements

These define performance and quality standards the system must meet.

- Fast load times (≤ 2s per page)
- High availability (99.9%)
- Secure data handling (encryption)
- Responsive across devices
- Scalable for 500+ users
- Accessible UI (WCAG compliant)
