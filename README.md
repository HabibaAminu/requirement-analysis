## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.
Requirement analysis is important because it is a foundational phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that development efforts are focused on solving the right problems, for the right users, in the right way.
